# Project Notes

## Environment
- `gh` CLI is installed at `/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe` — use this full path since it's not on the bash PATH.

## Repo Hygiene

### On session start
- Run `git status`, `git stash list`, and `git branch -a` to check for uncommitted changes, lingering stashes, stale branches, or divergence from remote.
- Flag any issues to the user before starting work.

### After push or PR
- Run `git status`, `git stash list`, `git branch -a`, and `git fetch --prune` to verify clean state.
- Flag any stale branches, uncommitted changes, or divergence.
- Ask the user what they'd like to work on next.
